<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 1 pound cranberry beans (like Borlotti) </li>
<li> 8 cups of water </li>
<li> 15 medium cloves of garlic, peeled and trimmed </li>
<li> 2 big shallots (I might have used a white onion but didn't have one), sliced on the axis into thin crescents </li>
<li> 2-3 dried smoked chiles (I used smoked serranos) but I suspect dried chipotles or even one or two chipotles from the can (in adobo sauce) would work nicely </li>
<li> 2 teaspoons+  fine sea salt for seasoning </li>
<li> a drizzle of flavorful extra-virgin olive oil </li>
<li> a small handful of cilantro, chopped </li>
<li> a couple (optional) handfuls of a salty hard cheese, Parmesan, grated (I think my mystery cheese was actually Three Sisters Serena) </li>
</ul>
