<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 3 to 4 cups of seasonal stone fruit - I like to use cherries early in the summer, and move onto peaches, nectarines, plums, and berries as the season progresses. You can use a single type of fruit or play around with different combinations Try punctuating peaches with a sprinkling of raspberries and a splash of creme de framboise. You will need to pit your fruit, and peel it in the case of fuzzy peaches or apricots. Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces. </li>
<li> 1 cup organic heavy whipping cream, well chilled </li>
<li> 2 egg yolks </li>
<li> 3 T. maple sugar </li>
<li> A splash of fruit liqueur (for example: if I am using peachs, I add peach brandy) </li>
<li> Preheat the oven to 400˚F. </li>
</ul>
