<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> Paprika oil: </li>
<li> 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil </li>
<li> 1 large clove of garlic, crushed </li>
<li> 1 Tablespoon bittersweet paprika </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika </li>
<li> Cumin oil: </li>
<li> Toast 1 T. cumin seeds in a dry skillet until fragrant, a couple minutes over medium heat. Crush the toasted cumin with a mortar and pestle - or a spice grinder, knife or whatever you've got. Back to the skillet: add 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet, let it heat up and add the crushed cumin seeds along with a few pinches of salt. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 or 15 minutes.  </li>
<li> Cumin croutons: </li>
<li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut a small loaf of rye bread into crouton-sized cubes. In a medium bowl toss a couple handfuls of the rye cubes with the cumin oil until they are nicely coated. Place on a baking sheet in the oven for 15 minutes or so - until the croutons are crisp and starting to brown. </li>
</ul>
