<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 1 1/4 pounds carrots </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (or clarified butter) </li>
<li> 2 medium cloves garlic, minced </li>
<li> 1 large yellow onion, chopped </li>
<li> 3 cups+ vegetable stock or water </li>
<li> juice of 1/2 a lemon </li>
<li> fine grain sea salt (as much as you need) </li>
<li> - olive oil, toasted sesame oil, or red chile oil for a finishing drizzle - if you use toasted sesame oil (sometimes labeled pure sesame oil) it is very strong. I typically dilute it with olive oil. I use one part sesame oil to four parts olive oil. </li>
</ul>
