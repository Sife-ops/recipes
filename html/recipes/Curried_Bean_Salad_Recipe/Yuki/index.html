<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 3 cups cooked beans - I used equal amounts Pebble beans and Mayacoba beans, but you could certainly use white beans, black beans, black eyed beans, whatever - I bet edamame would be great in this salad. And while I like to cook my beans from their dried state, this is a forgiving salad and canned beans that have been well rinsed will work too. You can serve this salad hot or at room temperature, whatever your preference. </li>
<li> 1 cup cooked black lentils* </li>
<li> 1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced into crescents </li>
<li> 3/4 cup celery, chopped </li>
<li> 1 clove garlic </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon of fine-grain sea salt </li>
<li> 1 1/2 teaspoons of your favorite curry powder </li>
<li> 1-2  teaspoons freshly grated ginger (from 1-inch cube of fresh ginger, peeled) </li>
<li> juice of 1/2 a lemon </li>
<li> 1/3 cup olive oil </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped </li>
</ul>
