<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> Pizza dough: </li>
<li> I've had success with White Whole Wheat Pizza Dough or  Peter Reinhart's Napoletana Pizza Dough recipe. </li>
<li> Toppings:  </li>
<li>  - my favorite five minute tomato sauce </li>
<li> - caramelized fennel &amp; olives:  Made by slicing fennel thinly, but not paper thin (a mandolin does the job). In a large skillet over med-high heat,  saute the fennel in olive oil for 3 or 4 mins, to brown a bit. Turn down the heat to low and cook for another fifteen to twenty minutes. A few minutes before the fennel is done, toss in a handful of your favorite pitted olives. </li>
<li> - Gruyere cheese, grated </li>
</ul>
