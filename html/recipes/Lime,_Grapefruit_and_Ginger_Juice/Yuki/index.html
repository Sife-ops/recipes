<!-- If you're looking for a jolt something bright, invigorating, spicy and citrusy - this is just the thing. You steep grated ginger in a bit of sugared water, and then strain it into a lime &amp; grapefruit juice blend. It's from the Rose Bakery inspired cookbook, which a number of us are cooking from in the coming weeks. -->
