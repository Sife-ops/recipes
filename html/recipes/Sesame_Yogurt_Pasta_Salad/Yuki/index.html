<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> Sauce: </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil </li>
<li> 1 medium garlic clove, minced </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander </li>
<li> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon turmeric </li>
<li> 1/2 cup / 120 ml warm water </li>
<li> 1/2 cup / 120 ml tahini (sesame paste) </li>
<li> 1/2 cup / 120 ml plain or Greek yogurt </li>
<li> 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice </li>
<li> fine grain sea salt </li>
<li> Salad: </li>
<li> a big handful of broccoli florets </li>
<li> a big handful of cauliflower florets </li>
<li> a big handful of green beans, cut into 1 1/2-inch segments </li>
<li> 1/2 pound / 8 oz / 225 g stuffed pasta (ravioli, etc) </li>
<li> a big handful/scoop of cherry tomatoes, raw or roasted </li>
<li> a small handful torn basil and/or cilantro </li>
<li> Get a big pot of water started - you are going to want to bring it to a boil.  </li>
<li> While the water is heating, make the sauce. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne, and turmeric. Stir well, and saute for just 15-30 seconds, or until the spices are toasted and fragrant. Transfer this mixture to a medium mixing bowl and stir in the water, tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Taste and adjust to your liking - you most likely will need a bit more salt. Set aside. </li>
<li> Salt the pot of water generously, and boil the broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans. Boil just 30 seconds, and quickly fish out with a slotted spoon. Run the vegetables under cold water to stop cooking. Drain well and set aside in a large mixing bowl. </li>
<li> Return the water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, then drain and run under cold water. Really try to shake off any extra water, then add to the vegetables. Add the tomatoes, and toss gently. You can toss with half of the sauce at this point, or serve the salad with dollops of the sauce on top - to be tossed at the table. It's prettier this way. Sprinkle with the basil/cilantro (and basil flowers if you have them) and serve. Serve the extra sauce on the side - any leftover makes a good dip later in the week. </li>
