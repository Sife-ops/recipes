<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons unsifted bleached all-purposed flour </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda </li>
<li> 3/4 teaspoon salt </li>
<li> 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg </li>
<li> 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened </li>
<li> 1 1/2 cups superfine sugar </li>
<li> 3 large eggs </li>
<li> 2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract </li>
<li> 3/4 cup thick, cultured sour cream </li>
<li> 1 cup tightly packed sweetened flaked coconut </li>
<li> Coconut Cream Frosting (see recipe below), without the addition of the sweetened flaked coconut, for topping the baked cupcakes </li>
<li> About 1 1/2 cups sweetened flaked coconut, to top the frosted cupcakes </li>
<li> Bakeware needed: </li>
<li> 8 jumbo muffin/cupcake cups (two pans each holding six individual muffin cups), each cup measuring 4 inches in diameter, 1 3/4 inches deep, with a capacity of about 1 1/8 cups (hs note: I used standard muffin pans. When I filled the cups 2/3 full, I got nice classic cupcakes. When I filled to the top I got big, jumbo-style cupcakes. Both were great, and plenty jumbo for me.) </li>
<li> Nonstick cookware spray, for preparing the muffin/cupcake pans </li>
<li> 12 ounces (one and one-half 8-ounce packages) cream cheese, softened </li>
<li> 5 tablespoons (1/4 stick plus 1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, softened </li>
<li> 2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract </li>
<li> 3 tablespoons heavy cream </li>
<li> 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg </li>
<li> 5 1/2 cups unsifted confectioners' sugar (hs note: I used a bit more) </li>
<li> 3/4 cup lightly packed sweetened flaked coconut </li>
</ul>
