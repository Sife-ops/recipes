<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 2 cups cranberries, picked over </li>
<li> 2 cups water </li>
<li> 2 cups sugar (see head notes) </li>
<li> More sugar for coating: I do a mix of medium-grained organic sugar for the first coating, and then a second toss with regular granulated white sugar. You don't want a huge grain for that first toss, just something larger than standard sugar, smaller than most turbinado sugars. You can sort of see the different grain sizes in the third photo in the main write-up. </li>
</ul>

<!-- Around the holidays these pretty, sparkling sugared cranberries are perfect. Tart and sweet, they glint and wink in the surrounding holiday lights, and lend a striking dash of red to the table. -->
